# Gallery

This is an example gallery application that lets the user change between
two galleries and open images in a lightbox. It applies lazy loading for the
images based on user scroll and photo data is only loaded once the lightbox is
opened.

Technologies used:
* React
* Yarn
* Babel
* Karma and Mocha
* ESDoc
* ESLint

Works with all modern browsers starting from IE10.
